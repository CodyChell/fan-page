        I love building PC's! They are so much fun to build and make your own.

    <h3 id="header3">Optional PC parts to buy. </h3>
        <div id="optional1"> Now that you have the require items that you need. There are some optional items that you can get while you're building your PC.</div>
    
    <ul>
    <li id="ssd">SSD for hard drive replacement. I highly reccommend getting this part along side a taditional rotating spinning drive.  </li>
    <li >Keyboard and Mouse replacement. Something like a mechanical keyboard.</li>
        <li >Network card if necessary. </li>
        <li >Monitor</li>
        <li >Optical drive (You probably don't need this)</li>
        
        
    </ul>
        
        <div id="optional">Since these are all optional items you don't have to get them. Some though, are highly reccommended.</div>
