        <p>
        I love building PC's! They are so much fun to build and make your own.  
        </p>
    
        <p>First I can talk about a few things about PC building. <br>
        A few things to start out what you need to buy.</p>

    <dl>
    <dt>Processor</dt>
        <dd>You can choose between two companies who both make processors.You have AMD and Intel to choose from. <br>
            Now days AMD is usually the cheaper option for someone who is looking to be on a budget. <br>
            Intel on the other hand does offer cheaper options and often with better per-core performance at the moment.</dd>
        
    <dt>CPU Cooler</dt> 
    <dt>Motherboard</dt> 
    <dt>RAM</dt> 
    <dt>Graphics Card</dt>
        <dd>The GPU (Graphic processing unit) is the part of the computer that is going to be specialized for graphic functions. It is going to allow you to play games at higher resolutions and graphical fidelity than a itergrated GPU on the processor. <br>
        You also have two options here. The companies that manufacture these cards are going to be AMD and Nvidia. </dd>
        
        
    <dt>Hard drive(s)</dt>
        <dd>Two options here you can choose a traditional rotatitng spinning drive or an SSD(Solid State Drive) <br>
        It's always best to get a HDD(hard disk drive) for bulk storage (&gt;1TB). Then get an SSD for faster storage to put your operating system on and other highly used applications.  </dd>
        
    <dt>Power Supply</dt>
        
        <dt>Case</dt>
    <dt>Operating System</dt>
        <dd> - Option to choose between a Microsoft Windows &copy; distribution or a Linux distribution. </dd>

        </header>
        
        <div id="optional1"> Now that you have the require items that you need. There are some optional items that you can get while you're building your PC.</div>
    
    <ul>
    <li>SSD for hard drive replacement. I highly reccommend getting this part along side a traditional rotating spinning drive.  </li>
    <li >Keyboard and Mouse replacement. Something like a mechanical keyboard.</li>
    <li >Network card if necessary. </li>
    <li >Monitor</li>
    <li >Optical drive (You probably don't need this)</li>
        
        
    </ul>
        
        <div id="optional">Since these are all optional items you don't have to get them. Some though, are highly reccommended.</div>
